Capital News Service Data Reporters Dylan Manfre and Natalie Davis compiled data from Montgomory County, Maryland and Prince George's County, Maryland, to analyze car thefts in the state. The data was obtained via open data portals.
We decided to look at four years worth of data from 2020 to 2023 to analyze how many car thefts have happend in the state. It has become a national trend that hits every day Marylanders.
The project is in collaboration with The Baltimore Banner.
